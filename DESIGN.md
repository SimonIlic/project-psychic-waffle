# Design document psychic waffle

Below a flowchart of the apps activities is shown. The main activity, wich will be shown on regular startup, is drawn red. A key design idea of the app is to be as simple and fast as possible. In order to beat *datumprikkers* a user should have to go through as little trouble as possible when trying to schedule a meeting. This is also seen by looking at the activity flow for first time users: after creating an account a user is immediatly prompted with a screen to create a new group and schedule a meeting.

Creating a group will follow whatsapps group creation flow as this will be most intuative to a new user. Groups may be created with non-users who will be sent an invite link to start using the app.
