This is a process book. It provides details of insights and steps taken during the development of this project.

> ### Note the first two days were spent on a rejected project proposal
# day 1
* proposed the project idea
* looked into feasibility of the project
** so far this seems promising as playback seems to be allowed when a video is out of focus but still in view
>
# day 2
* started process book
* found other apps with similar functions:
> * [Flytube](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/flyperinc/flytube/flytube-1-01-rc4-release/flytube-1-01-rc4-android-apk-download/ "Flytube")
> * [Stream](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.djit.apps.stream "Stream: player for youtube")
* this confirms to me that the project is feasible in theory
